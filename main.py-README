# Data Analytics — Sales EDA
This project performs exploratory data analysis on a sales dataset, including cleaning, aggregation, and a summary CSV report. It uses pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for a simple visualization.

**How to run**
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python main.py`

**Customize**
- Replace `data/sample_sales.csv` with your dataset and update `RAW_CSV` variable.
- Update cleaning logic in `clean_data()` to reflect your real columns and rules.
